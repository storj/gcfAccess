Google Cloud Function definitions for manipulating Access Grants

Real world Storj workflows often use S3 for all of their upload and 
download needs. However, S3 does not address other user needs, such 
as the ability to manage Access Grants.

This tool exposes a simple option for HTTP + JSON based Storj 
Access Grant management that doesn't require the complexities of 
uplink-c and language bindings.
